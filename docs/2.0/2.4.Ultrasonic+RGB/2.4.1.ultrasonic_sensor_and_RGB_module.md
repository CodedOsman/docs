## Building the circuit

Things Needed:

- Arduino Uno = 1
- Arduino USB cable = 1
- Jumper wires
- ultrasonic Sensor = 1
- Breadboard = 1
- RGB Module = 1

## Mounting the component on the breadboard

## PROGRAMMING

**Step 1:** Open your Arduino IDE. See how to set up here: [Getting Started](../../getting-started/overview.md).

**Step 2:** Type `const int Echo = 2; `

![create a threshold](../../assets/2.0/ultrasonic_Sensor/thres.webp).

**NB:** Make sure you avoid errors when typing. Do not omit any character or symbol especially the bracket {} and semicolons; and place them as you see in the image. The code that comes after the two ash backslashes “//” are called comments. They are not part of the code that will be run, they only explain the lines of code. You can avoid typing them.

**Step 9:** In the {} after the
`pinMode (Echo, INTPUT);`
`pinMode (Trig, OUTPUT); `
`Serial.begin (9600);`
`pinMode (Red, OUTPUT);`
`pinMode (Yellow, OUTPUT);`
`pinMode (Green, OUTPUT);`

as shown below in the picture below:

![initialize the variables](../../assets/2.0/ultrasonic_Sensor/initialize.webp).

**Step 10:** In the {} after the
`digitalWrite (Trig, LOW); `
`delay (200);`
`digitalWrite (Trig, HIGH); `
`delay (100);`
`digitalWrite (Trig, LOW);`
`duration = pulseIn (Echo, HIGH);`
`distance = duration * 0.034/2;`
as shown below in the picture below:

![Type this void loop](../../assets/2.0/ultrasonic_Sensor/Picture18.webp).

**Step 11:** Type This Function as shown in the image below.

`if (distance < dis_threshold) {`
`digitalWrite (Red, HIGH); `
`delay(200)`
`digitalWrite (Red, LOW); `

`delay(200)`
`digitalWrite (Blue, LOW); `
`delay(200)`
`digitalWrite (Green, HIGH); `
`delay(200)`
`digitalWrite (Green, LOW); `
`else{`
`digitalWrite (Red, LOW);`
`digitalWrite (Blue, LOW);`
`digitalWrite (Green, LOW);`

`Serial.println (“cm”);`
`delay (100);`
`distance = duration * 0.034/2;} `
as shown in the picture below.

**Step 12:** Save your code. _See the [Getting Started](../../getting-started/overview.md) section_

**Step 13:** Select the arduino board and port _See the [Getting Started](../../getting-started/overview.md) section:Selecting Arduino Board Type and Uploading your code_.

**Step 14:** Upload your code. _See the [Getting Started](../../getting-started/overview.md) section:Selecting Arduino Board Type and Uploading your code_

**Step 15:** Click on the serial monitor icon to view the amount of sound being recorded as shown in the picture below:

## CONCLUSION

If you encounter any problems when trying to upload your code to the board, run through your code again to check for any errors or missing lines of code. If you did not encounter any problems and the program ran as expected, Congratulations on a job well done.
