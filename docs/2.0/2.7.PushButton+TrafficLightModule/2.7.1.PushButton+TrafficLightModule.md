# Project 2.7.1:Push Button with Traffic Light Module

| **Description** | You will learn how to create a simple circuit using an Ultrasonic distance sensor and the buzzer. |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Use case**     | Imagine you want to program a pedestrian traffic light to allow pedestrians to cross the street at the push of a button. |

## Building the circuit

Things Needed:

-	Arduino Uno = 1
-	Arduino USB cable = 1
-	Traffic Light= 1
-	Breadboard = 1
-	Pushbutton = 1



## Mounting the component on the breadboard
Things Needed:

-   Traffic Light Module = 1
-   Push Button = 1
-   Breadboard = 1


**Step 1:** 
-	The push button has four unassigned pins.
-	On the middle section of the breadboard, locate each horizontal section lettered A to J.
-	Take the push button and insert two pins into the lettered section ‘g’ horizontally.
-	Insert the other two pins into the lettered section ‘d’ horizontally.

**Step 2:** 
-	The Traffic light module has four pins (Red(R), Yellow(Y)), Green(G) and GND.
-	On the middle section of the breadboard, locate each horizontal section lettered A to J.
-	Take the RGB module and insert it into any of the lettered section (Say A) horizontally.

## WIRING THE CIRCUIT

### Things Needed:

-   Red male-male-to-male jumper wires = 2
-   White male-to-male jumper wires = 2
-   Green male-to-male jumper wires = 2
-   Yellow male-to-male jumper wires = 2
-   Arduino Uno Board 



**Step 3:**  Take the Red male-male-to-male jumper wire and place one side of the wire pin under the push button pin located on the lettered section ‘d’ and the other side of the wire pin to the digital pin 2 on the Arduino uno board.

**Step 3:** Type ```int RED = 3;``` as shown in the picture below. 

![Pinmode decalration](../../assets/2.0/2.3.%20PushButton%20+%20TrafficLightModule/code2.webp).

**Step 4:** Type ```int YELLOW = 3;``` as shown in the picture below. 

![Pinmode decalration](../../assets/2.0/2.3.%20PushButton%20+%20TrafficLightModule/code3.webp).

**Step 5:** Type ```int GREEN = 3;``` as shown in the picture below. 

![Pinmode decalration](../../assets/2.0/2.3.%20PushButton%20+%20TrafficLightModule/code4.webp).

**Step 6:** Type ```int buttonState= 0;``` as shown in the picture below. 

![Pinmode decalration](../../assets/2.0/2.3.%20PushButton%20+%20TrafficLightModule/code5.webp).

**Step 7:** After the (void setup ()) within the curly brackets type
``` cpp
pinMode (ButtonPin, INTPUT_PULLUP); 
pinMode (RED, OUTPUT);
pinMode (YELLOW, OUTPUT);
pinMode (GREEN, OUTPUT);

```

![Pinmode decalration](../../assets/2.0/2.3.%20PushButton%20+%20TrafficLightModule/code6.webp).

**Step 8:** After the (void loop ()) within the curly brackets type as shown below 
``` cpp
buttonState = digitalRead (ButtonPin); 
```


![Pinmode decalration](../../assets/2.0/2.3.%20PushButton%20+%20TrafficLightModule/code7.webp).

**Step 9:**  Type Function
``` cpp
 if (buttonState == HIGH) {
digitalWrite (GREEN, HIGH); 
} else
```

![Pinmode decalration](../../assets/2.0/2.3.%20PushButton%20+%20TrafficLightModule/code8.webp).

**Step 10:** Type Function
``` cpp
if (buttonState == LOW) {
digitalWrite (GREEN, HIGH); 
delay (1000);
digitalWrite (GREEN, LOW); 
delay (1000);
digitalWrite (YELLOW, HIGH); 
delay (2000);
digitalWrite (YELLOW, LOW); 
delay (1000);
digitalWrite (RED, LOW); 
delay (5000);
digitalWrite (RED, LOW); 
delay (1000);
digitalWrite (GREEN, LOW); 
} 
```

**Step 11:** Save your code. _See the [Getting Started](../../getting-started/overview.md) section_

**Step 12:** Select the arduino board and port _See the [Getting Started](../../getting-started/overview.md) section:Selecting Arduino Board Type and Uploading your code_.

**Step 13:** Upload your code. _See the [Getting Started](../../getting-started/overview.md) section:Selecting Arduino Board Type and Uploading your code_

## CONCLUSION

If you encounter any problems when trying to upload your code to the board, run through your code again to check for any errors or missing lines of code. If you did not encounter any problems and the program ran as expected, Congratulations on a job well done.
