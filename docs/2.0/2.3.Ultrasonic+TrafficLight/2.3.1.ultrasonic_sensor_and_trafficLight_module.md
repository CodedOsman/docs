## Building the circuit

Things Needed:

- Arduino Uno = 1

- Jumper wires
- ultrasonic Sensor = 1
- Breadboard = 1

## PROGRAMMING

**Step 1:** Open your Arduino IDE. See how to set up here: [Getting Started](../../getting-started/overview.md).

**Step 2:** Type `const int Echo = 2; `
as shown below in the picture below: on line one before void Setup() function.

![create Echo variable](../../assets/2.0/ultrasonic_Sensor/Picture10.webp).

**Step 3:** Type `int Trig = 3;  `
as shown below in the picture below: on line one before void Setup() function.

![create Trig variable](../../assets/2.0/ultrasonic_Sensor/Picture11.webp).

**Step 4:** Type `int Red = 4; `

![create a threshold](../../assets/2.0/ultrasonic_Sensor/threshold.webp).

**NB:** Make sure you avoid errors when typing. Do not omit any character or symbol especially the bracket {} and semicolons; and place them as you see in the image. The code that comes after the two ash backslashes “//” are called comments. They are not part of the code that will be run, they only explain the lines of code. You can avoid typing them.

**Step 9:** In the {} after the

`pinMode (Echo, INTPUT);`
`pinMode (Trig, OUTPUT); `
`Serial.begin (9600);`
`pinMode (Red, OUTPUT);`
`pinMode (Yellow, OUTPUT);`
`pinMode (Green, OUTPUT);`

as shown below in the picture below:

![initialize the variables](../../assets/2.0/ultrasonic_Sensor/initialize.webp).

**Step 10:** In the {} after the

`digitalWrite (Trig, LOW); `
`delay (200);`
`digitalWrite (Trig, HIGH); `
`delay (100);`
`digitalWrite (Trig, LOW);`
`duration = pulseIn (Echo, HIGH);`
`distance = duration * 0.034/2;`
as shown below in the picture below:

![Type this void loop](../../assets/2.0/ultrasonic_Sensor/Picture18.webp).

**Step 11:** Type This Function as shown in the image below.

`if (distance == red_threshold)`
`digitalWrite (Red, HIGH); `
`else`
`digitalWrite (Red, LOW); `
`if (distance == yellow_threshold)`
`digitalWrite (Yellow, HIGH); `
`else`
`digitalWrite (Yellow, LOW); `
`if (distance == green_threshold)`
`digitalWrite (Green, HIGH); `
`else`
`digitalWrite (Green, LOW); `
`Serial.print (distance);`
`Serial.println (“cm”);`
`delay (100);`
`distance = duration * 0.034/2; `
as shown in the picture below.
