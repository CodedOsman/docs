## **Common Erros**
It is normal for anyone to encounter an error. These are some shared 
experiences our users have encounterd and how they solved it.

##  LEDs or components not lighting up

**Issues**

* Wires are connected to the wrong pins
* Components inserted incorrectly
* Code error in uploaded program

**Solution**

* Double-check wiring against the lesson diagram 
* Ensure component polarity is correct (e.g. LEDs have a + and -)
* Review your code for syntax or logic errors

## Sensors giving incorrect or no readings

**Issues**

* Incorrect wiring
* Sensor not compatible with loaded code
* Faulty sensor module

**Solution**

* Check if the sensor is connected to the correct pins
* Make sure the sample code matches the sensor model
* Try a different sensor to rule out hardware failure

## Not able to finishing uploading 

**Issues**

* Not able to upload your code


**Solutions**

* Check your Port connection
* Check your codes if every line is terminated
* Check if you have selected Arduino Uno from Tools

## If LED fail's to turn On

**Issues**

* Led failing to turn On 

**Solution**

* Check your Pin connection
* Check if your jumper wires are connected to the designed pin on the **Arduino** uno and breadboard
* Check to see if your **Pin Number** is accurate
