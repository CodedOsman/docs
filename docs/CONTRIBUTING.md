## 1. Fork the Repository

Forking creates your own copy of the project that you can work on.

1. Go to the main repository page.
2. Click on the **Fork** button (located at the top-right corner of the page).

---

## 2. Clone the Repository

Once you‚Äôve forked the repository, you‚Äôll need to clone it to your local machine.

1. Open your terminal (or Git Bash).
2. Run the following command (replace `your-username` with your GitHub username):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/docs.stemaide.com.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the directory you just cloned:
   cd docs.stemaide.com

## 3. Create a New Branch

Creating a new branch helps keep your changes organized and separate from the main project.

1. Create a new branch with a descriptive name
   ```bash
   git checkout -b update-readme
   ```
   Replace 'update-readme' with a name that describes your changes (e.g., fix-typo, add-section)

## 4. Make Your Changes

Now it‚Äôs time to edit the documentation files! We use Markdown for all documentation files.

1. Open the project in your text editor (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text).
2. Locate the file you want to edit (e.g., README.md or a file in the docs/ folder).
3. Make your changes or add new content in Markdown.

   Markdown Example
   Here‚Äôs a quick Markdown example to help you:

   # Heading 1
   Use a single hash(#) symbol for this effect.
   ## Heading 2
   Use a double hash(##) for th1is effect.
   ### Heading 3
   Use a triple hash(###) for this effect.

   - Bullet point: Use hyphen(-) symbol.

   **Bold Text**: Wrap your text between two asteriks(**).

   [Find the markdown cheatsheet here](assets/markdown_cheat_sheet_opensource.com_.pdf).

4. Save your changes when you are done.

## 5. Update the Changelog

Every change you make should be recorded in the CHANGELOG.md file.

1. Open the CHANGELOG.md file.
2. Add an entry under the appropriate version heading. If no version heading exists, create one:

## 6. Push Your Changes

Now that you‚Äôve made and saved your changes, you‚Äôll need to push them to your forked repository.

1. Stage your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
2. Commit your changes with a meaningful message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Added contribution guide and updated changelog"
   ```
3. Push your changes to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin update-readme
   ```

## 7. Create a Pull Request

A pull request (PR) is how you ask to merge your changes into the main repository.

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the Pull Requests tab.
3. Click on the New Pull Request button.
4. Select your branch (e.g., update-readme) and compare it with the main repository‚Äôs branch (usually main or master).
5. Add a title and description for your PR:
    - Title: Added Contribution Guidelines
    - Description: Describe the changes you made, e.g., ‚ÄúAdded detailed steps for contributing and updated the changelog.‚Äù
6. Click Create Pull Request.

## 8. Wait for Review

The project maintainers will review your pull request. Here‚Äôs what might happen:

1. Approved: Your changes will be merged into the main project!
2. Requested Changes: Maintainers might ask for modifications. Follow their feedback and update your PR.

3. To update your PR after feedback:

    - Make the required changes in your local branch.
    - Commit and push the changes:
      ```bash
      git add .
      git commit -m "Fixed feedback issues"
      git push origin update-readme
      ```
