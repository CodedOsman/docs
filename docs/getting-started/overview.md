# Getting Started
Here's a quick overview of what you can expect from our guides:

## The Arduino IDE and Basic Set Up
**Step 1:** Double click on the Arduino IDE icon on your computer / laptop to open Arduino IDE.

**Step 4:** Left Click before the ( void setup () ) and click on the Enter key on your keyboard to get space at the top of the void setup(). Then click above the void setup().

_**NB:** we will write the necessary code and comment at the space we created above the void setup ()._

## Comment
In programming, a comment is a piece of text that is added to the source code of a program to provide information or explanations. Comments are intended for human readers and are ignored by the compiler or interpreter when the program is executed.

_**NB:** before you type a comment, type two slash (//) before you complete your sentence._

<summary> Selecting Arduino Board Type and Uploading your code</summary>

**Step 1:** Select the Board type. 
Click on tools on the menu bar hover your mouse on Board, a new window will appear. Look through and click on Arduino UNO.
