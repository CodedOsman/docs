## PROGRAMMING

**Step 1:** Open your Arduino IDE. See how to set up here: [Getting Started](../../getting-started/overview.md).

**Step 2:**  Write the following codes as flows.
``` cpp
const int trigPin = 9;    // Ultrasonic Sensor Trig Pin
const int echoPin = 10;   // Ultrasonic Sensor Echo Pin
const int redLed = 6;     // Red Light
const int yellowLed = 7;  // Yellow Light
const int greenLed = 8;   // Green Light

// Variables for Distance Measurement
long duration;
int distance;

void setup() {
  // Initialize Sensor Pins
  pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(echoPin, INPUT);

  // Initialize Traffic Light Pins
  pinMode(redLed, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(yellowLed, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(greenLed, OUTPUT);

  // Begin Serial Communication (for debugging)
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // Measure distance using the ultrasonic sensor
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
  delayMicroseconds(2);
  digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(10);
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
  
  // Calculate the distance in cm
  duration = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);
  distance = duration * 0.034 / 2;

  // Print the distance to the Serial Monitor
  Serial.print("Distance: ");
  Serial.print(distance);
  Serial.println(" cm");

  // Control the Traffic Light Based on Distance
  if (distance <= 10) { // Vehicle detected close to the intersection
    digitalWrite(redLed, HIGH);   // Red Light ON
    digitalWrite(yellowLed, LOW);
    digitalWrite(greenLed, LOW);
    delay(5000); // Wait for 5 seconds

  } else { // No vehicle detected or vehicle is far
    digitalWrite(redLed, LOW);
    digitalWrite(yellowLed, LOW);
    digitalWrite(greenLed, HIGH); // Green Light ON
    delay(5000); // Wait for 5 seconds
    
    digitalWrite(greenLed, LOW);
    digitalWrite(yellowLed, HIGH); // Yellow Light ON
    delay(2000); // Wait for 2 seconds
    digitalWrite(yellowLed, LOW);
  }
}

```

**Step 19:** Save your code. _See the [Getting Started](../../getting-started/overview.md) section_

**Step 20:** Select the arduino board and port _See the [Getting Started](../../getting-started/overview.md) section:Selecting Arduino Board Type and Uploading your code_.

**Step 21:** Upload your code. _See the [Getting Started](../../getting-started/overview.md) section:Selecting Arduino Board Type and Uploading your code_


## CONCLUSION
The Smart Traffic Light System demonstrates how an ultrasonic sensor and Arduino can dynamically control traffic signals based on distance detection. This project enhances traffic management and road safety while providing hands-on experience with circuit building and coding.
