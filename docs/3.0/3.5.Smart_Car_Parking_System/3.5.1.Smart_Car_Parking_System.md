## PROGRAMMING

**Step 1:** Open your Arduino IDE. See how to set up here: [Getting Started](../../getting-started/overview.md).

**Step 2:** Type the following code in your arduino IDE at the top of "void setup() { }" function as shown in the picture below.
   ``` cpp
   #include <Servo.h>
   // Pin Definitions
   const int trig  = 6;
   const int echo = 7;
   const int motor = 8;
   const int red = 9;
   const int green = 10;
   const int blue = 11;

   // Objects and Variables
   Servo barrierServo;
   long duration;
   int distance;
   bool parkingAvailable = true;
   ```

![Code 1](../../assets/3.0/Smart_Car_Parking_System/code_1.webp)

**Step 3:** Type the following code inside of the "void setup() { }" function to initialize the pin modes

   ``` cpp
   // Pin Modes
   pinMode(trig, OUTPUT);
   pinMode(echo, INPUT);
   pinMode(red, OUTPUT);
   pinMode(green, OUTPUT);
   pinMode(blue, OUTPUT);

   // Initialize Servo
   barrierServo.attach(servoPin);
   barrierServo.write(90); // Barrier closed position

   Serial.begin(9600); // For debugging
   ```

![Code 2](../../assets/3.0/Smart_Car_Parking_System/code_2.webp)

**Step 4:** Type the following code under "void loop() { }" function. This code is a function to calculate the distance of objects from the ultrasonic sensor.

   ``` cpp
   // Function to get distance from ultrasonic sensor
   int getDistance() {
      digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
      delayMicroseconds(2);
      digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);
      delayMicroseconds(10);
      digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);

      duration = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);
      return duration * 0.034 / 2; // Convert to cm
   }
   ```

![Code 3](../../assets/3.0/Smart_Car_Parking_System/code_3.webp)

**Step 5:** Type the following code under the new function. This code is a function to control the color of the RGB module to indicate parking availability.

   ``` c++
   // Function to signal parking status
   void signalParkingStatus(bool available) {
      if (available) {
         // Green LED for available parking
         analogWrite(red, 0);
         analogWrite(green, 255);
         analogWrite(blue, 0);
      } else {
         // Red LED for occupied parking
         analogWrite(red, 255);
         analogWrite(green, 0);
         analogWrite(blue, 0);
      }
   }
   ```

![Code 4](../../assets/3.0/Smart_Car_Parking_System/code_4.webp)

**Step 6:** Type the following code inside of the "void loop() { }" function.

   ``` cpp
   // Get distance from ultrasonic sensor
   distance = getDistance();

   if (parkingAvailable) {
      if (distance < 20 && distance > 0) { // Car detected
         parkingAvailable = false;
         signalParkingStatus(false);
         barrierServo.write(0); // Open barrier
         delay(5000); // Wait for the car to park
         barrierServo.write(90); // Close barrier
      } else {
         signalParkingStatus(true);
      }
   } else {
      signalParkingStatus(false);
   }

   delay(200); // Loop delay
   ```
