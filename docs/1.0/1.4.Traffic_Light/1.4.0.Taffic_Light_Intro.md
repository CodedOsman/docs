# Project 1.4.0: TRAFFIC LIGHT

| **Description** | This is an interesting aspect where you’ll learn to program the traffic light just as the one you see in the communities.   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use case**    | You can create a traffic light to help prevent accidents, regulate traffic flow and also enhance safety in our environment. |

## Building the circuit

Things Needed:

- Arduino Uno = 1
- Arduino USB cable = 1
- Traffic light module = 1
- green jumper wires = 1
- red jumper wires = 1
- yellow jumper wires = 1
- White jumper wire= 1

## Mounting the component on the breadboard

**Step 1:** Take the Traffic light and the breadboard, insert the Traffic light into the horizontal connectors on the breadboard.

## WIRING THE CIRCUIT

### Things Needed:

- Green jumper wires = 1
- Red jumper wires = 1
- Yellow jumper wires = 1
- White jumper wire= 1

**step 1:** Take the red jumper wire. This wire will connect the Arduino UNO and the red light (red pin) of the traffic light. This pin is labeled “R” on the traffic light.

**step 2:** Connect one end of the red jumper wire to the red pin’s hole and the other end to the Arduino UNO. Ensure you place the pin in the right hole.

**step 3:** Connect the other end of the red pin to hole number 5 on the Arduino UNO.

**step 4:** Connect one end of the yellow jumper wire to Y of traffic light on the breadboard. Ensure you put the pin in the right hole on the breadboard and connect the other end of the yellow jumper wire to pin number 6 on the Arduino UNO.

**step 5:** Connect one end of the green jumper wire to G of traffic light on the breadboard. Ensure you put the pin in the right hole on the breadboard and connect the other end of the green jumper wire to pin number 7 on the Arduino UNO.

## PROGRAMMING

**Step 1:** Open your Arduino IDE. See how to set up here: [Getting Started](../../getting-started/overview.md).

**Step 2:** Type the following codes before the void setup function.

``` cpp
const int red = 5;
const int yellow = 6;
const int green = 7;
```

**Step 3:** Type the following codes in the void setup function as shown below;

``` cpp
 pinMode (red, OUTPUT);
pinMode (yellow, OUTPUT);
pinMode (green, OUTPUT);
```

**Step 4:** Type the following codes in the void loop function as shown below;

``` cpp
 digitalWrite (green, HIGH);
delay (3000);
digitalWrite (green, LOW);
delay (3000);
```

**Step 5:** Now let make the yellow blink by typing the following codes;

``` cpp
  digitalWrite (yellow, HIGH);
delay (1000);
digitalWrite (yellow, LOW);
delay (1000);
```

**Step 6:** Now let make the Red also blink by typing the following codes;

``` cpp
 digitalWrite (red, HIGH);
delay (2000);
digitalWrite (red, LOW);
delay (2000);
```
