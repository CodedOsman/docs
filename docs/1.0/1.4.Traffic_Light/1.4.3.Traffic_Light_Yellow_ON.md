# Project 1.4.3: YELLOW MEANS GET READY

| **Description** | This teaches you how to turn ON and also turn OFF the yellow light only on the traffic light module.              |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use case**    | Programming the yellow light on the traffic to turn ON which will signal drivers and riders to get ready to stop. |

## Building the circuit

Things Needed:

- Arduino Uno = 1
- Arduino USB cable = 1
- Traffic light module = 1
- Yellow jumper wires = 1
- White jumper wire= 1

## Mounting the component on the breadboard

**Step 1:** Take the Traffic light and the breadboard, insert the Traffic light into the horizontal connectors on the breadboard.

## WIRING THE CIRCUIT

### Things Needed:

- yellow male-male-to-male jumper wires = 1
- White jumper wire = 1

**step 1:** Take the yellow jumper wire. This wire will connect the Arduino UNO the yellow light (yellow pin) of the traffic light. This pin is labeled “Y” on the traffic light.

**step 2:** Connect one end of the yellow jumper wire to Y pin of traffic light on the breadboard. Ensure you put the pin in the right hole.

**step 3:** Connect the other end of the yellow jumper wire to pin number 6 on the Arduino UNO.

**step 4:** Take the white jumper wire and connect one end to the GND pin of the traffic light.

**step 5:** Connect the other end of the white jumper wire to GND on the Arduino UNO.

## PROGRAMMING

**Step 1:** Open your Arduino IDE. See how to set up here: [Getting Started](../../getting-started/overview.md).

**Step 2:** Type `   const int yellow = 6;` before the void setup function.

**Step 3:** Type the following codes in the void setup function as shown below;

``` cpp
pinMode (yellow, OUTPUT);
```

**Step 4:** Type the following codes in the void loop function as shown below;

``` cpp
digitalWrite (yellow, HIGH);
```

The digitalWrite () function controls the state of the pin. The pin can either be HIGH or LOW. The HIGH state turns on the LED. As a result, the code below turns on the LED.

**NB:** To turn off the traffic light
**Step 5:** Change the ` digitalWrite (yellow, HIGH);` into ` digitalWrite (yellow, LOW);`.

## Uploading the code

**Step 1:** Save your code. _See the [Getting Started](../../getting-started/overview.md) section_

**Step 2:** Select the arduino board and port _See the [Getting Started](../../getting-started/overview.md) section:Selecting Arduino Board Type and Uploading your code_.

**Step 3:** Upload your code. _See the [Getting Started](../../getting-started/overview.md) section:Selecting Arduino Board Type and Uploading your code_

## OBSERVATION

When the circuit is functioning, observe the yellow LED of the tgrafic ligth emitting light as expected. This indicates that the buzzer is receiving the signal correctly from the Arduino and is operating as intended.

## CONCLUSION

summary, the project centeyellow on the illumination of a yellow light in a simulated traffic light system provides a fundamental understanding of basic electronics and visual signaling. By lighting the yellow LED, participants grasp the concept of circuit connections, output control, and the role of color-coded signals. This undertaking serves as a cornerstone in electronics exploration, illustrating the significance of clear visual cues and sparking interest in practical applications, such as traffic management and safety systems.
