# Project 6: Car front and rear lights

| **Description** | This is a project that exposes you to programming four LEDS to turn on at the same time.|
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Use case**     | At night, we mostly see cars having two lights in front of them turned on at the same time, and at this same time, the two red LEDS at the back too are also on. This project has similar usage and interface. |

## Mounting the component on the breadboard

## Mounting the component on the breadboard

**Step 1:** Take the breadboard, the white LED and insert it into the vertical connectors on the breadboard.

_**NB:** Make sure you identify where the positive pin (+) and the negative pin (-) is connected to on the breadboard. The longer pin of the LED is the positive pin and the shorter one, the negative PIN_.

## WIRING THE CIRCUIT

**Step 2:** Connect one end of red male-to-male jumper wire to the positive pin of the white LED on the breadboard and the other end to hole number 6 on the Arduino UNO.

_make sure you connect the arduino usb use blue cable to the Arduino board_.

## PROGRAMMING

**Step 1:** Open your Arduino IDE. See how to set up here: [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started).

**Step 2:** Type the following codes in the void setup function as shown in the image below.
   
   ```
   pinMode(6,OUTPUT);
   pinMode(5,OUTPUT);
   pinMode(4,OUTPUT);
   pinMode(3,OUTPUT);
   ```

_**NB:** pinMode will help the Arduino board to decide which port should be activated.  The code below will turn off the three light bulbs._

**Step 3:** Type the following codes in the void loop function.as shown in the image below;
   ```
   digitalWrite(6,HIGH);
   digitalWrite(5,HIGH);
   digitalWrite(4,HIGH);
   digitalWrite(3,HIGH);
   ```

_**NB:** To turn this LEDS off, you can change the “HIGH” in the ode into “LOW” _

**Step 4:** Save your code. _See the [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started) section_

**Step 5:** Select the arduino board and port _See the [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started) section:Selecting Arduino Board Type and Uploading your code_.

**Step 6:** Upload your code. _See the [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started) section:Selecting Arduino Board Type and Uploading your code_
