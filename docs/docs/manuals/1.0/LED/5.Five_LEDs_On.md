# Project 7: INCREASING BRIGHTNESS IN A ROOM

| **Description** | This is a project that exposes you to programming five LEDS to turn on at the same time.|
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Use case**     | You enter into a room and the lights in there is very bright and shines like the sun. It’s basically because more LEDS have been introduced in bulb or circuit.|

## Mounting the component on the breadboard

## Mounting the component on the breadboard

**Step 1:** Take the breadboard, the white LED and insert it into the vertical connectors on the breadboard.

_**NB:** Make sure you identify where the positive pin (+) and the negative pin (-) is connected to on the breadboard. The longer pin of the LED is the positive pin and the shorter one, the negative PIN_.

## WIRING THE CIRCUIT


**Step 2:** Connect one end of red male-to-male jumper wire to the positive pin of the white LED on the breadboard and the other end to hole number 6 on the Arduino UNO.

_make sure you connect the arduino usb use blue cable to the Arduino board_.

## PROGRAMMING

**Step 1:** Open your Arduino IDE. See how to set up here: [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started).

**Step 2:** Type the following codes in the void setup function as shown in the image below.
   
   ```
   pinMode(6,OUTPUT);
   pinMode(5,OUTPUT);
   pinMode(4,OUTPUT);
   pinMode(3,OUTPUT);
   pinMode(2,OUTPUT);
   ```

_**NB:** pinMode will help the Arduino board to decide which port should be activated.  The code below will turn off the three light bulbs._

**Step 3:** let continue by ting the following codes;
   ```
   digitalWrite(6,HIGH);
   digitalWrite(5,HIGH);
   digitalWrite(4,HIGH);
   digitalWrite(3,HIGH);
   digitalWrite(2,HIGH);
   ```
