# Project 3: DOUBLE LED BLINK

| **Description** | Double LED blink is a project that gives deeper insight on programming LEDS where you will program two LEDS to turn on and off one after the other. |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Use case**     | The police siren uses two different light colors (blue and red) but one turns on for a number of mini seconds then it goes off for the other to turn on and go off. This cycle repeats itself and thatâ€™s how come we have the police light siren. |

## Building the circuit

### Things Needed:

-	Arduino Uno = 1
-	Arduino USB cable = 1
-	White LED = 1
-	Red LED = 1
-	Red jumper wires = 1
-	Blue jumper wires = 1

## Mounting the component on the breadboard

## Mounting the component on the breadboard

**Step 1:** Take the breadboard, the white LED and insert it into the vertical connectors on the breadboard.

_**NB:** Make sure you identify where the positive pin (+) and the negative pin (-) is connected to on the breadboard. The longer pin of the LED is the positive pin and the shorter one, the negative PIN_.

## WIRING THE CIRCUIT

### Things Needed:

- Red male-male-to-male jumper wires = 1
- Black male-to-male jumper wires = 1
- White male-to-male jumper wires = 1
- Blue male-to-male jumper wires = 1

**Step 2:** Connect one end of red male-to-male jumper wire to the positive pin of the white LED on the breadboard and the other end to hole number 6 on the Arduino UNO.

**Step 5:** Connect one end of the black male-to-male jumper wire to the positive pin of the red LED on the breadboard and the other end to hole number 5 on the Arduino UNO.

**Step 6:** Connect one end of the black male-to-male jumper wire to the positive pin of the red LED on the breadboard and the other end to hole number 5 on the Arduino UNO.

_make sure you connect the arduino usb use blue cable to the Arduino board_.

## PROGRAMMING

**Step 1:** Open your Arduino IDE. See how to set up here: [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started).

**Step 2:** Type the following codes in the void setup function as shown in the image below.
   ```
   pinMode (6, OUTPUT);
   pinMode (5, OUTPUT);
   ```

_**NB:** pinMode will help the Arduino board to decide which port should be activated. The code below will turn off the two light bulbs._

**Step 3:** Type the following codes in the void setup function as shown below. 

   ```
   digitalWrite (6, HIGH);
   delay (1000);
   digitalWrite (6, LOW);
   delay (1000);
   digitalWrite (5, HIGH);
   delay (1000);
   digitalWrite (5, LOW);
   delay (1000);
   ```
