# Project 2: CAR TRAVIGATOR BLINKING

| **Description** | This project teaches how to program an LED to turn on and off within a time interval (Blink) without a human being having to turn on and off the switch. |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Use case**     | This knowledge forms the basis for home automation. It is also a steppingstone to controlling smart lights, leading to advanced lighting setups in modern smart homes. |

## Building the circuit

Things Needed:

-	Arduino Uno = 1
-	Arduino USB cable = 1
-	White LED = 1
-	Red jumper wires = 1
-	Blue jumper wires = 1


## Mounting the component on the breadboard

**Step 1:** Take the breadboard, the white LED and insert it into the vertical connectors on the breadboard.

_**NB:** Make sure you identify where the positive pin (+) and the negative pin (-) is connected to on the breadboard. The longer pin of the LED is the positive pin and the shorter one, the negative PIN_.

## WIRING THE CIRCUIT

### Things Needed:

- Red male-male-to-male jumper wires = 1
- Blue male-to-male jumper wires = 1


**Step 2:** Connect one end of red male-to-male jumper wire to the positive pin of the white LED on the breadboard and the other end to hole number 6 on the Arduino UNO.

_just as shown above, connect your USB cable to the Arduino board and to your laptop._

## PROGRAMMING

**Step 1:** Open your Arduino IDE. See how to set up here: [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started).

**Step 2:** Type ``` pinMode (6, OUTPUT);``` in the void Setup() function.

**Step 3:** Type the following codes in the void loop function as shown below;

   ```
   digitalWrite (6, HIGH);
   delay (1000);
   digitalWrite (6, LOW);
   delay (1000);
   ```
