# Project 5: TRAFFIC LIGHT

| **Description** | This is an interesting project where you program three LEDS to turn on and go off one after the other.|
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Use case**     | In our society, we do have traffic lights that help direct cars and prevent accidents.|

## Mounting the component on the breadboard

## Mounting the component on the breadboard

**Step 1:** Take the breadboard, the white LED and insert it into the vertical connectors on the breadboard.

_**NB:** Make sure you identify where the positive pin (+) and the negative pin (-) is connected to on the breadboard. The longer pin of the LED is the positive pin and the shorter one, the negative PIN_.

## WIRING THE CIRCUIT

### Things Needed:

- Red male-male-to-male jumper wires = 1
- Black male-to-male jumper wires = 1
- White male-to-male jumper wires = 1
- Blue male-to-male jumper wires = 1

**Step 2:** Connect one end of red male-to-male jumper wire to the positive pin of the white LED on the breadboard and the other end to hole number 6 on the Arduino UNO.

_make sure you connect the arduino usb use blue cable to the Arduino board_.

## PROGRAMMING

**Step 1:** Open your Arduino IDE. See how to set up here: [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started).

**Step 2:** Type the following codes in the void setup function as shown in the image below.
   ```
   pinMode (6, OUTPUT);
   pinMode (5, OUTPUT);
   pinMode(4,OUTPUT);
   ```

_**NB:** pinMode will help the Arduino board to decide which port should be activated.  The code below will turn off the three light bulbs._

**Step 3:** Type the following codes in the void loop function.as shown in the image below;
   ```
   digitalWrite (6, HIGH);
   delay (1000);
   digitalWrite (6, LOW);
   delay (1000);   
   // this codes above will turn on and of the white LED 

   digitalWrite (5, HIGH);
   delay (1000);
   digitalWrite (5, LOW);
   delay (1000);  
   // this codes above will turn on and of the red LED 

   digitalWrite (4, HIGH);
   delay (1000);
   digitalWrite (4, LOW);
   delay (1000);  
   // this codes above will turn on and of the yellow LED 
   ```

_**NB:** To turn this LEDS off, you can change the “HIGH” in the ode into “LOW” _

**Step 4:** Save your code. _See the [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started) section_

**Step 5:** Select the arduino board and port _See the [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started) section:Selecting Arduino Board Type and Uploading your code_.

**Step 6:** Upload your code. _See the [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started) section:Selecting Arduino Board Type and Uploading your code_

## OBSERVATION

## CONCLUSION

In brief, the three-LED blinking project offers a hands-on introduction to coordinated LED control. By creating a blinking pattern across three LEDs, participants gain insights into circuit connections, programming loops, and synchronization. This endeavor serves as a stepping stone for more complex electronics undertakings while illustrating the concept of repetitive actions, sparking interest in practical electronics applications.
