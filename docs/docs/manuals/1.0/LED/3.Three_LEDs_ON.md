# Project 4: Triple LEDS

| **Description** | This is the project where you’ll program three LEDS to turn on at the same time.|
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Use case**     | Looking at our streetlights, we normally have more lights on at the same time. This is what you are going to imitate with just three LEDS. |

## Building the circuit

Things Needed:

-	Arduino Uno = 1
-	Arduino USB cable = 1
-	White LED = 1
-	Red LED = 1
-	Yellow LED = 1
-	Red jumper wires = 1
-	Blue jumper wires = 1
-	Black jumper wires = 1
-	White jumper wires = 1
-	Green jumper wires = 1

## Mounting the component on the breadboard

## Mounting the component on the breadboard

**Step 1:** Take the breadboard, the white LED and insert it into the vertical connectors on the breadboard.

_**NB:** Make sure you identify where the positive pin (+) and the negative pin (-) is connected to on the breadboard. The longer pin of the LED is the positive pin and the shorter one, the negative PIN_.

## WIRING THE CIRCUIT

### Things Needed:

- Red male-male-to-male jumper wires = 1
- Black male-to-male jumper wires = 1
- White male-to-male jumper wires = 1
- Blue male-to-male jumper wires = 1

**Step 2:** Connect one end of red male-to-male jumper wire to the positive pin of the white LED on the breadboard and the other end to hole number 6 on the Arduino UNO.

_make sure you connect the arduino usb use blue cable to the Arduino board_.

## PROGRAMMING

**Step 1:** Open your Arduino IDE. See how to set up here: [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started).

**Step 2:** Type the following codes in the void setup function as shown in the image below.
   ```
   pinMode (6, OUTPUT);
   pinMode (5, OUTPUT);
   pinMode(4,OUTPUT);
   ```

_**NB:** pinMode will help the Arduino board to decide which port should be activated.  The code below will turn off the three light bulbs._

**Step 3:** Type the following codes in the void loop function.as shown in the image below;
   ```
   digitalWrite(6,HIGH);
   digitalWrite(5,HIGH);
   digitalWrite(4,HIGH);
   ```

_**NB:** To turn this LEDS off, you can change the “HIGH” in the ode into “LOW” _

**Step 4:** Save your code. _See the [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started) section_

**Step 5:** Select the arduino board and port _See the [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started) section:Selecting Arduino Board Type and Uploading your code_.

**Step 6:** Upload your code. _See the [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started) section:Selecting Arduino Board Type and Uploading your code_

## OBSERVATION

## CONCLUSION

To summarize, the project focused on simultaneously illuminating three LEDs without any blinking demonstrates a core understanding of parallel LED control. By activating all three LEDs concurrently, participants learn about basic circuitry connections and the concept of multiple output coordination. This project lays a cornerstone for more intricate electronics projects while highlighting the importance of synchronized actions, fostering curiosity and skills in the field of practical electronics.
