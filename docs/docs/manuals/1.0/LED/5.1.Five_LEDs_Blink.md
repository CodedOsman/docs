# Project 8: PARTY LIGHTNENING

| **Description** | This project is focused on turning 5 lights on and off one after the other. |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Use case**     | Entering into a party area, you might see the room glowing with five different beautiful bright lights, turning on and going off one after the other which makes the room very nice and giving it an attractive/decorative setting. |

_**NB:** Make sure you identify where the positive pin (+) and the negative pin (-) is connected to on the breadboard. The longer pin of the LED is the positive pin and the shorter one, the negative PIN_.

## WIRING THE CIRCUIT


**Step 2:** Connect one end of red male-to-male jumper wire to the positive pin of the white LED on the breadboard and the other end to hole number 6 on the Arduino UNO.

## PROGRAMMING

**Step 1:** Open your Arduino IDE. See how to set up here: [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started).

**Step 2:** Type the following codes in the void setup function as shown in the image below.
   
   ```
   pinMode(6,OUTPUT);
   pinMode(5,OUTPUT);
   pinMode(4,OUTPUT);
   pinMode(3,OUTPUT);
   pinMode(2,OUTPUT);
   ```

**Step 3:** Type the following codes in the void loop function.as shown in the image below;
   ```
   digitalWrite (6, HIGH);
   delay (1000);
   digitalWrite (6, LOW);
   delay (1000);
   ```

## CONCLUSION

In a nutshell, the project centered around five blinking LEDs offers hands-on experience in synchronized LED control. By creating a blinking pattern across all five LEDs, participants gain insights into circuit connections, loop-based programming, and coordinated timing. This endeavor serves as a stepping stone for more advanced electronics projects, highlighting the concept of repetitive actions and sparking interest in practical electronics applications.
