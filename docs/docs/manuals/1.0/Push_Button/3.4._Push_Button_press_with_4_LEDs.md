# Project 13: MANUAL DANCING LIGHT

| **Description** | This is an intriguing Arduino project that demonstrates the control of four LEDs using just one push button. Pressing the button cycles through the LEDs, activating them in sequence, and releasing the button turns off all LEDs. Dive into the world of multi-LED control and button interaction in this captivating experiment. |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Use case**     | This can be applied as an innovative room ambiance enhancer. Place the four LEDs strategically around the room, each emitting a different hue. Guests can press the button to cycle through the LEDs, creating varying atmospheres to match different occasions or moods. Releasing the button turns off all LEDs, allowing for seamless transitions between lighting settings. This project showcases a creative way to transform a space with just a single button press. |
