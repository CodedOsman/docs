# Project 14: TRI-LIGHT

| **Description** | Tri-light is a creative Arduino project that employs a single push button to manage the illumination of three LEDs. Pressing the button cycles through the LEDs, turning each on sequentially, and releasing the button turns off all LEDs. Explore the concept of state management and LED control in this engaging endeavor. |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Use case**     | Tri-light can be utilized as an attention-grabbing party decoration. Set up the three LEDs in vibrant colours. When the party starts, guests can press the button to illuminate each LED in a dynamic sequence. Releasing the button turns off all LEDs. This project offers an entertaining way to add a touch of interactivity to gatherings and events, captivating participants with colourful light displays. |

## Building The Circuit

Tools Needed:

-   Arduino Uno = 1
-	Arduino USB cable = 1
-	Resistor = 1
-	Push button = 1
-	Red LED = 1
-	Red jumper wires = 1
-	Black jumper wires = 1
-	Yellow jumper wires = 1
-	Blue jumper wires = 1



## Mounting the component on the breadboard

Push Button = 1

**Step 1:** Connect the pushbutton on the breadboard but make sure the two pairs of the pins are connected on each side of the bridge.

## WIRING THE CIRCUIT

### Things Needed:

- Red male-male-to-male jumper wires = 1
- Black male-to-male jumper wires = 1
- Yellow male-to-male jumper wires = 1
- Blue male-to-male jumper wires = 1
- White male-to-male jumper wires = 1
- Green male-to-male jumper wires = 1

**Step 1:** Connect male-to-male jumper wire from one Pin of the Push Button as a negative to power GND (Ground) on the Arduino UNO.

_Make sure to connect the Arduino USB blue cable to the Arduino board_.


## PROGRAMMING

**Step 1:** Open your Arduino IDE. See how to set up here: [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started).

**Step 2:** Type ``` const int ledPin1 = 12;``` as shown in the picture below.

![Tri-light1](../../assets/1.0/Push_Button/Push_Button_3_LED/Tri-light_1.png).

**Step 3:** Type ``` const int ledPin2 = 9;``` as shown in the picture below.

![Tri-light1](../../assets/1.0/Push_Button/Push_Button_3_LED/Tri-light_2.png).

**Step 4:** Type ``` const int ledPin3 = 4;``` as shown in the picture below.

![Tri-light3](../../assets/1.0/Push_Button/Push_Button_3_LED/Tri-light_3.png).

**Step 5:** Type ``` const int buttonPin = 13;``` as shown in the picture below.

![Tri-light4](../../assets/1.0/Push_Button/Push_Button_3_LED/Tri-light_4.png).

**Step 6:** Type ``` int buttonState = 0;``` as shown in the picture below.

![Tri-light5](../../assets/1.0/Push_Button/Push_Button_3_LED/Tri-light_5.png).

**Step 7:** Inside the (void setup()), Type 
    ``` 
    pinMode (ledPin1, OUTPUT);
    pinMode (ledPin2, OUTPUT);
    pinMode (ledPin3, OUTPUT);
    pinMode (buttonPin INPUT_PULLUP) ;
    ``` 
  as shown in the picture below.

![Tri-light6](../../assets/1.0/Push_Button/Push_Button_3_LED/Tri-light_6.png).

**NB:** pinMode will help the Arduino board to decide which port should be activated. 

**Step 8:** Type ``` buttonState = digitalRead (buttonPin); ``` as shown in the picture below.

![Tri-light7](../../assets/1.0/Push_Button/Push_Button_3_LED/Tri-light_7.png).

**Step 9:** Type 
    ``` if (buttonState == LOW)
{    digitalWrite (ledPin1,  HIGH) ;
     digitalWrite (ledPin2, HIGH);
     digitalWrite (ledPin3, HIGH);
     digitalWrite (ledPin3, HIGH); }
    ``` 
  as shown in the picture below.

**Step 10:** Type 
    ``` else {  digitalWrite (ledPin1,  LOW) ;
     digitalWrite (ledPin2, LOW);
     digitalWrite (ledPin3, LOW);
     digitalWrite (ledPin3, HIGH); } ``` 
  as shown in the picture below.
