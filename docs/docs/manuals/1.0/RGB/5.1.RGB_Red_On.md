# Project 22: RED-G-B

| **Description** | This project is one that makes emphasis on how to create a simple circuit and to control a red light on the RGB. |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Use case**     | Wanting to create an interactive lighting system for your living room using as a security light, you can program the Red LED in the RGB alone to turn on whenever there’s an intruder. |

## Building the circuit

Things Needed:

-	Arduino Uno Board = 1
-	Arduino USB cable = 1
-	RGB= 1
-	Red jumper wires = 1
-	White jumper wires = 1

## Mounting the component on the breadboard

**Step 1:** The RGB module has four pins, R pin(red), G pin(green), B pin(blue) and – pin (GND). On the middle section of the breadboard, locate each horizontal section lettered A to J. Take the RGB module and insert it into any of the lettered section (Say A) horizontally. 

 _**NB:** Take note of where each of the pins of the RGB are placed on the bread board._

## WIRING THE CIRCUIT

Things Needed:

-	Red jumper wire = 1
-	white jumper wire = 1

**Step 2:** Take the red jumper wire. This wire will connect the Arduino UNO and the R pin of the RGB module. 

- Connect one end of the red jumper wire to R pin of RGB module on the breadboard. Ensure you put the pin in the right hole.

- Connect the other end of the red jumper wire to pin number 5 on the Arduino UNO.

**Step 3:** Take the white jumper wire and connect one end to the GND or the - pin of the RGB module.

- Connect the other end of the white jumper wire to GND on the Arduino UNO.

## PROGRAMMING

**Step 1:** Open your Arduino IDE. See how to set up here: [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started).

**Step 2:** Type ```const int red = 5;``` as shown below in the image.

_**NB:** Make sure you avoid errors when typing. Do not omit any character or symbol especially the bracket { }  and semicolons ;  and put them as you see in the image. The code that comes after the two ash backslashes “//” are called comments. They are not part of the code that will be run, they only explain the lines of code. You can avoid typing them._

**Step 3:** Type ```pinMode (red, OUTPUT);``` as shown below in the image.

_**NB:** The code below sets the pin names “red” as an output pin. An output pin helps send signals from the microcontroller to other components in the circuit. The pinMode () function, helps determine and control the behavior of a specific pin on the board_

**Step 4:** Type ```digitalWrite (red, HIGH);``` as shown below in the image.

The digitalWrite () function controls the state of the pin. The pin can either be HIGH or LOW. The HIGH state turns on the LED. As a result, the code below turns on the LED.

_**NB:** To turn off the red light,_
**Step 5:** Type ```digitalWrite (red, LOW);``` as shown below in the image.

_**NB:** The LOW state turns off the LED. Hence, you can include the code below in your main code if you want to turn your light off but you are not required to do so._

**Step 6:** Save your code. _See the [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started) section_

**Step 7:** Select the arduino board and port _See the [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started) section:Selecting Arduino Board Type and Uploading your code_.

**Step 8:** Upload your code. _See the [Getting Started](../../../../README.md#getting-started) section:Selecting Arduino Board Type and Uploading your code_

## CONCLUSION

To conclude, the project dedicated to turning on only the red light in an RGB configuration offers a foundational exploration of color representation and electronic control. By activating the red LED component, participants gain insights into color channels, circuit connections, and the isolated visual impact of a single color. This endeavor serves as a stepping stone in understanding RGB color manipulation, highlighting the unique role of each color component and inspiring curiosity in practical applications, such as customized lighting and visual communication systems.
